<a id="jerks-are-everywhere" class="anchor" href="#jerks-are-everywhere" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Jerks are Everywhere</h3>

<p>Those smug schmucks! Look at them -- double parking, littering, texting during movies, putting ketchup on a hot dog <em>(you monsters!)</em></p>

<h3>
<a id="they-deserve-shame" class="anchor" href="#they-deserve-shame" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>They Deserve Shame</h3>

<p>You know they deserve to be punished... but what can you do? You don't want to be the jerk that calls the police over something so minor and petty! The answer is <strong>shame</strong>. Public shame. They are probably only behaving like jerks in the first place because they've never been called out on it!</p>

<h3>
<a id="guardians" class="anchor" href="#guardians" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Guardians</h3>

<p><strong>Jerk du Jour</strong> lets you become guardians against jerkery. Report a jerk, and share their jerkishness with the world. Issue a citation to a jerk so they are acutely aware that they are being mercilessly snickered -- perhaps even chortled -- at on a public website! Earn badges. Earn promotions. And enforce classiness and civility wherever you go!</p>

<h3>
<a id="is-this-bullying" class="anchor" href="#is-this-bullying" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Is this Bullying?</h3>

<p><strong>No.</strong> Bullies are jerks. In fact, abusing <strong>Jerk du Jour</strong> for your own personal gain or to make baseless or excessive accusations is a very serious matter that won't be tolerated. We aim to be a lighthearted <em>(not quite whimsical)</em> safeguard against breaches of common courtesy, common sense, and common civility (see 'Jerks are Everywhere' above). Please refer actual crimes to actual police, and actual justice to the actual justice system.</p>
