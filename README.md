### Jerks are Everywhere
Those smug schmucks! Look at them -- double parking, littering, texting during movies, putting ketchup on a hot dog _(you monsters!)_

### They Deserve Shame
You know they deserve to be punished... but what can you do? You don't want to be the jerk that calls the police over something so minor and petty! The answer is **shame**. Public shame. They are probably only behaving like jerks in the first place because they've never been called out on it!

### Guardians
**Jerk du Jour** lets you become guardians against jerkery. Report a jerk, and share their jerkishness with the world. Issue a citation to a jerk so they are acutely aware that they are being mercilessly snickered -- perhaps even chortled -- at on a public website! Earn badges. Earn promotions. And enforce classiness and civility wherever you go!

### Is this Bullying?
**No.** Bullies are jerks. In fact, abusing **Jerk du Jour** for your own personal gain or to make baseless or excessive accusations is a very serious matter that won't be tolerated. We aim to be a lighthearted _(not quite whimsical)_ safeguard against breaches of common courtesy, common sense, and common civility (see 'Jerks are Everywhere' above). Please refer actual crimes to actual police, and actual justice to the actual justice system.

### The Commissioners
**Jerk du Jour** is being developed by Steven Fricke and Brian Shef. Contact them for questions or support. Contact them with delicious craft beer for _superb and timely_ support.
