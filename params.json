{"name":"Jerk du Jour","tagline":"Publicly shame those jerks!","body":"### Jerks are Everywhere\r\nThose smug schmucks! Look at them -- double parking, littering, texting during movies, putting ketchup on a hot dog _(you monsters!)_\r\n\r\n### They Deserve Shame\r\nYou know they deserve to be punished... but what can you do? You don't want to be the jerk that calls the police over something so minor and petty! The answer is **shame**. Public shame. They are probably only behaving like jerks in the first place because they've never been called out on it!\r\n\r\n### Guardians\r\n**Jerk du Jour** lets you become guardians against jerkery. Report a jerk, and share their jerkishness with the world. Issue a citation to a jerk so they are acutely aware that they are being mercilessly snickered -- perhaps even chortled -- at on a public website! Earn badges. Earn promotions. And enforce classiness and civility wherever you go!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
